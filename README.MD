## Recommended In-Ground Moisture Sensors

When monitoring soil moisture levels in areas such as home crawl spaces or gardens, using the right 
sensors is crucial for accurate data. In-ground moisture sensors can help determine whether additional 
drainage solutions, like a French drain, are necessary.

### Advantages of Long Stem Soil Moisture Sensors

- **Deeper Measurements:** Long stem sensors can measure moisture levels deeper in the soil, providing 
  a more comprehensive view of soil conditions at various depths.
- **Better Representation:** They offer a better representation of the moisture profile, especially 
  important for understanding subsurface water accumulation.
- **Improved Accuracy:** With measurements taken deeper in the soil, these sensors can detect moisture 
  levels that surface sensors might miss.

### Example Long Stem Soil Moisture Sensors

- **Decagon Devices GS3:** A robust sensor capable of measuring soil moisture, temperature, and 
  electrical conductivity. It is suitable for depths up to 24 inches.
- **Vegetronix VH400:** Known for its accuracy and durability, this sensor can be used at depths up to 
  20 inches and provides precise moisture readings.
- **METER Group TEROS 12:** Designed for scientific research and agriculture, this sensor offers 
  reliable moisture readings at depths of up to 20 inches.

## Key Points:

### Determining the Need for a French Drain:

1. **Assessing Soil Moisture:**
   - **High Moisture Levels:** Indicate poor drainage and potential water accumulation, suggesting 
     the need for a French drain.
   - **Low to Moderate Moisture Levels:** Suggest good drainage, potentially negating the need for 
     additional drainage solutions.

2. **Long-Term Monitoring:**
   - **Seasonal Changes:** Monitor moisture levels across seasons to identify consistent drainage 
     issues.
   - **After Rainfall:** Observe how quickly the soil moisture decreases post-rainfall to evaluate 
     drainage efficiency.

### Using the Soil Moisture Meter:

1. **Installation:**
   - Insert the soil moisture meter vertically into the ground to a depth of around 20 inches, 
     aligning with the typical depth of a French drain.

2. **Reading and Interpretation:**
   - **Calibration:** Ensure the sensor is correctly calibrated for the soil type to obtain accurate 
     readings.
   - **Data Logging:** Regularly log moisture data for analysis, either manually or using an automated 
     system connected to a microcontroller like the ESP32.

3. **Additional Considerations:**
   - **Soil Type:** Different soils have varying drainage properties, with sandy soils draining 
     quickly and clay soils retaining water longer.
   - **Surrounding Environment:** Consider the impact of nearby structures, vegetation, and terrain 
     slope on soil drainage.

By utilizing long stem soil moisture sensors, you can gather detailed and accurate information about 
soil moisture levels at significant depths. This data is instrumental in determining the need for 
drainage solutions like French drains, helping to prevent water accumulation and potential damage in 
areas such as home crawl spaces.
